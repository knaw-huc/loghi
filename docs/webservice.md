## Running the Web Service

The [`webservice`](webservice) directory contains a README with instructions on how to get started with running the Loghi web service for online transcription tasks. This setup is designed to provide an accessible way to engage with the service, catering both to those new to the platform and to seasoned users looking for advanced functionalities.

Within the [`webservice`](webservice) directory, you'll find a subdirectory named [`webservice-scripts`](webservice/webservice-scripts/) that includes detailed instructions and scripts for utilizing the entire transcription pipeline. These scripts are designed to demonstrate the workflow from start to finish, providing a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing the transcription process.
